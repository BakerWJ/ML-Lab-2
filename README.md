# Machine-Learning-Lab

This was a weekly lab done in Harvard's S-14A course. This was my first experience with building machine learning models with sklearn and XGBoost. The final product was built with a Flask backend. When run, the application will show the evaluation for a random property in the csv file and compare the predicted value to the actual value. Different model types explored in this project were XGBoost and different types of Forest models.
